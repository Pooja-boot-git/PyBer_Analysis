## Summary
1. Rural areas have a good potential of generating higher revenues as the average fare per driver is highest in rural areas. 
2. Rides to fare data looks consistent between urban and suburban cities.

## What can we do to improve our revenue?
1. We need to increase the strength of drivers in suburban cities as they have a very good potential of more revenue generation.
2. We should work on increasing the ride count per driver in the urban cities as we have a good amount of drivers to cover more rides.
3. We should look into why count of rides in rural areas is so less. What can we do to address that? Given the highest value of average fare in rural areas, increase in rides will be a big boost for the revenue.
